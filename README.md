# Fake Ransomware Prank

**Disclaimer: This is a harmless prank intended for fun. It doesn't lock, encrypt, or delete any files. Use responsibly and only with the consent of the person you're pranking!**

## How it Works:
This batch script simulates a ransomware attack by displaying a fake ransom message and pretending to "encrypt" files. It doesn't actually affect any files on the computer.

## How to Run:
1. Download the `prank.bat` file.
2. Run the script by double-clicking it.
3. Enjoy your friend's reactionâ€”but make sure they know it's a prank afterward!

## Prank Warning:
This is meant to be fun, but don't scare anyone too much!
